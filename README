OVERVIEW
====================================================================================================================

Stingray is a suite of Fortran routines to produce mock observing cones from semi-analytic models (SAMs).

V0.1  13/03/2018: First release
V0.6  09/10/2018: Various bug fixes
V0.7  26/10/2018: Separated user-module into a two modules for routines and selection function;
                  Added selection by "apparent mass" to reduce the amount of data in the positioning step
                  Added a correction of group positions that were 'wrapped away' from all group members
V0.8  10/12/2018: Fixed bug with galaxy counting in multi-threading mode
V0.9  26/02/2019: Updated HDF5 module for increased flexibility with data type conversions
V0.10 26/03/2019: Better commenting, copy parameter file, instead of rewriting it
V0.11 29/04/2019: Improved cosmology module, general clean up, improved makefile

GETTING STARTED
====================================================================================================================

1) Installations:
   a) make sure gfortran is installed (code tested for gfortran 4.4.7 and 5.0.0)
   b) make sure that HDF5 is installed (version 1.10.1 or higher)

2) In terminal, download Stingray
   > git clone https://github.com/obreschkow/stingray
   
3) Got to Stingray directory
   > cd stingray
   
4) Clean potential previous compilations
   > make clean
   
5) If needed, specify the HDF compiler flags for your system by adding a new block to the makefile
   ifeq ($(system),[your system name])
      hdfflags = [your HDF flats]
   endif
   
6) Compile the code by typing
   > make system=[your system name]
   NB: depending on the system, it might be necessary to load fortran and hdf5 packages,
       e.g. using a command like
       > module load gfortran/6.3.0 hdf5/1.10.2
   
7) Edit the parameter file parameter.txt, especially the input and output paths
   
8) Produce mock observing cone
   > ./stingray make_all [-parameterfile .../parameter.txt]
   
9) Check files written into output directory
   
10) Optionally, visualise the cone in R


ARGUMENTS
====================================================================================================================

Generally, Stingray is called as
> ./stingray routine [-option argument] [-option argument] ...

The routines to choose from are
+ make_tiling
+ make_sky
+ make_all = previous two together and additional routines, as specified in the user module

Optional arguments:

-parameterfile (default parameters.txt): path+filename of parameter-file

-logfile (default none) allows the user to specify a path+filename for the screen-log, which is particularly usefull
 if the code is executed using a queueing system
 
-version: returns the version of Stingray
